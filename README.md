# Svelte + Vite

For this project, I wanted to practice doing something interactive so I used Svelte to build this website. I started out in Svelte Playground, exported the code and did the finetuning locally in VS Code. I didnâ€™t use a template but wrote it from scratch (with some ChatGPT assistance). I used Vite to build the app (which was a bit of a struggle) but it was great to learn how to do it.<br>
I used R for the initial exploration of the lyrics and then did the analysis with Python. The charts are created in Datawrapper because it was the easiest way to get something nice-looking and somewhat interactive.<br>
With more time, I think this could be expanded with more aspects (flowers mentioned in the lyrics, for example) and I would improve the styling. I considered building the graphics directly in Svelte to customize them even more but I am not sure whether this really has any benefits over Datawrapper that would be worth the effort. As I'm still a scholar of literature at heart, I think there are some stories in the color analysis that could be explored in a paper/culture piece.<br>
The data for the lyrics comes from the Taylor Swift Lyrics API created by sarbor and the Shakespeare Dataset provided by BridgesData.<br>
