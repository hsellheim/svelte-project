Peter,"Forgive me, Peter\ My lost fearless leader\ In closets like cedar\ Preserved from when we were just kids\ Is it somethin' I did?\ The goddess of timing\ Once found us beguiling\ She said she was trying\ Peter, was she lying?\ My ribs get the feelin' she did\ And I didn't want to come down\ I thought it was just goodbye for now\ \ You said you were gonna grow up\ Then you were gonna come find me\ Said you were gonna grow up\ Then you were gonna come find me\ Said you were gonna grow up\ Then you were gonna come find me\ Words from the mouths of babes\ Promises oceans deep\ But never to keep\ Oh, never to keep\ \ Are you still a mind reader?\ A natural scene stealer?\ I've heard great things, Peter\ But life was always easier on you\ Than it was on me\ And sometimes it gets me\ When crossing your jet stream\ We both did the best we could do underneath the same moon\ In different galaxies\ And I didn't want to hang around\ We said it was just goodbye for now\ \ You said you were gonna grow up\ Then you were gonna come find me\ Said you were gonna grow up\ Then you were gonna come find me\ Said you were gonna grow up\ Then you were gonna come find me\ Words from the mouths of babes\ Promises oceans deep\ But never to keep\ Never to keep\ \ And I won't confess that I waited\ But I let the lamp burn\ As the men masqueraded\ I hoped you'd return\ With your feet on the ground\ Tell me all that you'd learned\ 'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned\ And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five\ And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired\ Lost to the Lost Boys chapter of your life\ Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried\ To hold onto the days when you were mine (Hold onto the days)\ But the woman who sits by the window has turned out the light\ \ You said you were gonna grow up\ Then you were gonna come find me\ Said you were gonna grow up\ You said you were gonna grow up\ Then you were gonna come find me\ Said you were gonna grow up\ You said you were gonna grow up\ Then you were gonna come find me\ Said you were gonna grow up\ Then you were gonna come find me\ Said you were gonna grow up\ Then you were gonna come find me\ Words from the mouths of babes\ Promises oceans deep\ But never to keep",11,The Tortured Poets Department,2024
The Bolter,"By all accounts, she almost drowned\ When she was six in frigid water\ And I can confirm she made\ A curious child, ever reviled\ By everyone except her own father\ With a quite bewitching face\ Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless\ Excellent fun till you get to know her\ Then she runs like it's a race\ Behind her back, her best mates laughed\ And they nicknamed her The Bolter\ \ Started with a kiss\ ""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""\ But it always ends up with a town car speeding\ Out the drive one evening\ Ended with the slam of a door\ Then he'll call her a whore\ Wish he wouldn't be sore\ But as she was leaving\ It felt like breathing\ All her fuckin' lives\ Flashed before her eyes\ It feels like the time\ She fell through the ice\ Then came out alive\ \ He was a cad, wanted her bad\ Just like any good trophy hunter\ And she liked the way it tastes\ Taming a bear, making him care\ Watching him jump then pulling him under\ And at first blush, this is fate\ When it's all roses, portrait poses\ Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats\ What a charming Saturday\ That's when she sees the littlest leaks\ Down in the floorboards\ And she just knows\ She must bolt\ \ Started with a kiss\ ""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""\ But it always ends up with a town car speeding\ Out the drive one evening\ Ended with the slam of a door\ Then he'll call her a whore\ Wish he wouldn't be sore\ But as she was leaving\ It felt like breathing\ All her fuckin' lives\ Flashed before her eyes\ It feels like the time\ She fell through the ice\ Then came out alive\ \ She's been many places with\ Men of many faces\ First they're off to the races\ And she's laughing drawin' aces\ But, none of it is changin'\ That the chariot is waitin'\ Hearts are hers for the breakin'\ There's escape in escaping\ \ Started with a kiss\ ""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""\ But it always ends with a town car speeding\ Out the drive one evenin'\ Ended with the slam of a door\ But she's got the best stories\ You can be sure\ That as she was leaving\ It felt like freedom\ All her fuckin' lives\ Flashed before her eyes\ And she realized\ It feels like the time\ She fell through the ice\ Then came out alive",11,The Tortured Poets Department,2024
Robin,"\ Long may you reign\ You're an animal\ You are bloodthirsty\ Out window panes talking utter nonsense\ You have no idea\ \ Strings tied to levers\ Slowed-down clocks tethered\ All this showmanship\ To keep it for you\ In sweetness\ Way to go, tiger\ Higher and higher\ Wilder and lighter\ For you\ \ Long may you roar\ At your dinosaurs\ You're a just ruler\ Covered in mud, you look ridiculous\ And you have no idea\ \ Buried down deep and out of your reach\ The secret we all vowed\ To keep it from you\ In sweetness\ Way to go, tiger\ Higher and higher\ Wilder and lighter\ For you\ \ You got the dragonflies above your bed\ You have a favorite spot on the swing set\ You have no room in your dreams for regrets\ You have no idea\ The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean\ You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline\ But now we'll curtail your curiosity\ In sweetness\ \ Way to go, tiger\ Way to go, tiger\ Higher and higher\ Higher and higher\ Wilder and lighter\ For you",11,The Tortured Poets Department,2024
The Manuscript,"\ Now and then she re-reads the manuscript\ Of the entire torrid affair\ They compared their licenses\ He said, ""I'm not a donor but\ I'd give you my heart if you needed it""\ She rolled her eyes and said, ""You're a professional""\ He said, ""No, just a Good Samaritan""\ He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was\ Soon they'd be pushing strollers\ But soon it was over\ \ In the age of him she wished she was thirty\ And made coffee every morning in a French press\ Afterward she only ate kids' cereal\ And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed\ Then she dated boys who were her own age\ With dartboards on the backs of their doors\ She thought about how he said\ Since she was so wise beyond her years\ Everything had been above board\ She wasn't sure\ \ And the years passed like scenes of a show\ The professor said to write what you know\ Looking backwards might be the only way\ To move forward\ Then the actors were hitting their marks\ And the slow dance was alight with the sparks\ And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score\ And at last\ She knew what the agony had been for\ \ The only thing that's left is the manuscript\ One last souvenir from my trip to your shores\ Now and then I re-read the manuscript\ But the story isn't mine anymore",11,The Tortured Poets Department,2024
